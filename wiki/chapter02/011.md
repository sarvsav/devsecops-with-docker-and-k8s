# Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call
on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build` users can create
an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in
succession.

## Example

A simple Dockerfile that builds a Go application. The code can be found HERE.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20

WORKDIR /go/src/app

COPY go.mod ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .

RUN go build -v -o /go/bin/app ./...

CMD ["/go/bin/app"]
```

## Why to build a docker image?

The docker image is a read-only template with instructions on how to run a
container. It is like the class of an object and containers are the instances or
objects of the class.

## How to build the docker image

Building the docker image is done using the `docker build` command.

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## How to run the docker image

Running the docker image is done using the `docker run` command.

```bash
docker run --name <container-name> <image-name>
```

## Linting Dockerfile

`hadolint` is a linter for Dockerfile, and can be installed using the following
command.

```bash
## Create a bin directory in your home directory, if not exists
mkdir -p ~/bin
## find the url for latest version of the hadolint
latest_hadolint=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/hadolint/hadolint/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep -i windows | grep -iv 256)
## Download the hadolint binary to the bin directory
curl -sL $latest_hadolint -o ~/bin/hadolint.exe
```
